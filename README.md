Where does the search bar go?
=============================

According to surveys, pundits, opinions and convention it should go in there somewhere at the top of a web view. Mobile apps also follow this pattern. I don't really have any other argument other than it's where everyone puts it and it's where users expect it to be. Good enough for me.

Let's see who in the Alexa [Top Sites in United States](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US) is following convention. I surveyed the top twenty-five websites and yielded the following results:

### Alexa 1 - 25

#### Top of the View Location: 72%
* top-left: 12% (3, 7, 16)
* top-left-center: 16% (1, 2, 5, 15)
* top-center: 16% (4, 13, 20, 25)
* top-right: 28% (6, 8, 10, 18, 21, 22, 23)

#### Nestled Among Content: 16%
* left-column: 8% (9, 24)
* center-column: 4% (14)
* right-column: 4% (17)

#### Nowhere: 12%
* didn't have one: 12% (11, 12, 19)

## Hint: It belongs at the top, preferably on the right side

I went a little further and scoped out the searchbar location for the [26-50 Top Sites in United States](http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries;1/US), mostly pr0n and Godaddy customers so I'll save you from the screencaps, and I learned a little more:

### Alexa 26 - 50

#### Top of the View Location: 64%
* top-left: 8% (34, 44)
* top-left-center: 8% (32, 41)
* top-center: 16% (35, 36, 40, 42)
* top-right: 32% (26, 27, 28, 33, 37, 38, 39, 50)

#### Nestled Among Content: 8%
* left-column: 0%
* center-column: 4% (45)
* right-column: 4%  (29)

#### Nowhere: 12%
none: 28% (30, 31, 43, 46, 47, 48, 49)

Godaddy has two search bars. Please use [DNSimple](https://dnsimple.com/).

So to recap the Top 50 in toto, 68% had the searchbar located at the top of the view, 20% didn't have one or did not apply and only 12% had the searchbar nestled among the content somewhere.
