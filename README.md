Where does the search bar go?
=============================

According to surveys, pundits, opinions and convention it should go in the somewhere at the top of a web view. Mobile apps also follow this pattern. I don't really have any other argument oter than it's where everyone puts it and it's where users expect it to be. Good enough for me.
